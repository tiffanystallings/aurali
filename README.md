# Project Aurali
## Under Construction!
I decided it would be fun to build a game engine for the HTML5 canvas to continue building and applying my JavaScript knowledge. There's not much to see here yet, but there will be a functioning engine here soon.

## Contributions
Since this is more of a learning device for me at the moment, I'll likely be hesitant to accept any pull requests. However! Any advice and bug reports can be reported with an Issue. As I get more confident and as this project grows, I'll be happy to bring on contributors, but as yet I'm still but a noob!

## Updates
